 2. **WhatToPlay Project**  
   A lighthearted project that answers the classic gamer dilemma: *“What should I play right now?”* The first iteration of the platform features a spinning wheel that randomly selects a game from the user’s list — making decision fatigue a thing of the past.

3. **GeekCommerce Platform (Design & Diagrams Focusing)**  
   A conceptual **e-commerce platform for geek culture enthusiasts**, focusing on the visual and structural side of business analysis.
