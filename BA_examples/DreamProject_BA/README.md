# Dream Project / Zanarkand Project

## What Is Dream Project?

Dream Project (aka *Zanarkand Project*) is a web-based companion for preserving every chapter of your gaming story. Whether you’re grinding through a long JRPG, chasing a new personal best, or revisiting a childhood classic, the platform helps you save, organize, and revisit your progress in one place.  

It’s designed as a personal archive and a showcase at the same time: a space where your saves, achievements, and screenshots gradually form a structured history of your gaming life. This is your story. 🌀

## Core Features

- **Seamless Save Backups**  
  Upload, store, and restore your game saves across supported platforms. The system keeps your save files safely backed up so that hardware failures, OS reinstalls, or accidental overwrites don’t erase your progress. Your adventures stay available whenever you decide to return to them.

- **Achievement & Milestone Tracker**  
  Track both official and fan-made achievement lists for each game. Official achievements are auto-imported and clearly labelled, while community lists can be created, versioned, and collaboratively edited (including themed challenge sets like difficulty runs or special challenges).  
  Each achievement has a dedicated page with criteria description, media attachments, threaded comments, and optional flags (e.g., storyline achievement, irreversible unlock, “final completion” indicator). Users can discuss and rate full lists, with flagged or low-rated items moving into a moderation queue. The system also provides completion statistics: the percentage of users who have completed each achievement or list, plus lists of users (nicknames, avatars, timestamps) and the real time taken to unlock specific sets.

- **Digital Sticker Album**  
  Turn your screenshots into collectible “stickers” organised into custom album templates. Curators define album structures per game (locations, characters, plot elements, etc.), with support for multiple themes and optional spoiler warnings in descriptions.  
  Screenshots are dragged into album slots and checked by an AI-driven validation layer that verifies basic consistency and filters out inappropriate content. Spoiler-flagged images are automatically blurred until a user chooses to reveal them. Completing an album grants a game-specific badge on the user’s profile and exposes completion statistics (who completed which album and how long it took)

## Deliverables Overview

All business analysis materials for Dream Project are grouped into two main packages: **Documents** and **Visuals**.
