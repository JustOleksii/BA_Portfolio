# BA Documentation Deliverables

Hello and welcome to the End of Time ⏳
Or, if seriously, here you’ll find links to the core documents that define why the **Dream Project** product exists, what it should do, and how we will confirm it delivers value. Each link opens a standalone artefact from the `/Documents` package.

## 📑 What’s Inside

🔹 **[Business Case](./business-case.md)**  
  Outlines the business challenge, project objectives, expected benefits, and key risks and assumptions. This document helps stakeholders and sponsors understand *why* Dream Project is worth investing in.

🔹 **[Business Analysis Document](./business-analysis-document.md)**  
  Provides the broader business context: stakeholder landscape, current vs. future state (gap analysis), high-level processes, and business rules. It’s the foundation for understanding how the product fits within its organisational and user ecosystem.

🔹 **[Stakeholder & Communication Plan](./stakeholder-and-communication-plan.md)**  
  Identifies key stakeholders, their interests and influence, and defines how and when they will be engaged (channels, frequency, responsibilities). This document ensures expectations are managed and that the right people are involved at the right time. 

🔹 **[Business Requirements Document (BRD)](./brd.md)**  
  Captures the business requirements and high-level capabilities needed to achieve the project objectives, along with priorities and scope boundaries. It connects strategic intent with technical delivery.

🔹 **[System Requirements Specification (SRS)](./srs.md)**  
  Details the functional and non-functional requirements, integrations, data mappings, and user stories with acceptance criteria. This serves as the main reference for designers, developers, and QA engineers during implementation.

🔹 **[Use Case Specification](./use-case-specification.md)**  
  Defines key interactions between users and the system — including actors, preconditions, main and alternative flows, and expected results. It provides a shared understanding of real-world system usage.

🔹 **[Risk & Assumptions Register](./risk-and-assumptions-register.md)**  
  Records known risks and assumptions along with their likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies. It supports proactive decision-making and risk management throughout the project.

🔹 **[Project Plan](./project-plan.md)**  
   Presents a high-level timeline of milestones, releases, activities, and dependencies, giving stakeholders a realistic view of *when* and *how* outcomes will be delivered.

🔹 **[Test Case Specification](./test-case-specification.md)**  
  Contains detailed test scenarios linked directly to requirements and use cases. It defines how each deliverable will be verified and what “done” means from a QA perspective.

🔹 **[Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)](./rtm.md)**  
  Maps relationships between business goals, requirements, system features, use cases, and test cases. This ensures every implemented function can be traced back to a validated business need.
