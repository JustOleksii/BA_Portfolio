Below is an overview of the main sections of this Stakeholder & Communication Plan.  
Use the links to jump directly to the part you’re interested in.

- **[1. Introduction & Purpose](#1-introduction--purpose)**  
  Explains why this plan exists, how it relates to the Business Case and Business Analysis Document, and who should use it. Clarifies that the focus is on *who* we communicate with, *about what*, *how*, and *how often*.

- **[2. Stakeholder Landscape Overview](#2-stakeholder-landscape-overview)**  
  Summarises the key stakeholder groups for Dream Project (players, curators, creators, admins, external partners) and how they connect to the product. Provides a quick “map” before diving into details.

- **[3. Stakeholder Group Profiles](#3-stakeholder-group-profiles)**  
  Describes each stakeholder group in more detail: who they are, what they care about, what they fear, and what success looks like for them. Acts as a reference when deciding how to tailor messages.

- **[4. Influence, Interest & Engagement Strategy](#4-influence-interest--engagement-strategy)**  
  Positions each stakeholder group on an influence/interest matrix and defines the corresponding engagement approach (e.g. manage closely, keep satisfied, keep informed, monitor). Links business priority to communication effort.

- **[5. Communication Objectives](#5-communication-objectives)**  
  Defines the high-level goals of communication for Dream Project (e.g. aligning expectations, motivating curators, gathering feedback from players, managing external partners).

- **[6. Communication Plan by Stakeholder Group](#6-communication-plan-by-stakeholder-group)**  
  Provides a structured view of **who** gets **what** information, **when**, **how**, and **from whom**.  
  Typical columns: stakeholder group, key messages, frequency, channel, format, and owner.

- **[7. Key Meetings & Touchpoints](#7-key-meetings--touchpoints)**  
  Lists recurring ceremonies and checkpoints (e.g. internal planning, curator syncs, community updates, beta feedback sessions) and explains their purpose, participants, and cadence.

- **[8. Channels & Tools](#8-channels--tools)**  
  Describes the main communication channels used for each audience type (e.g. email, Discord/Slack, issue tracker, in-platform notifications, documentation) and how they fit together.

- **[9. Escalation & Decision-Making Paths](#9-escalation--decision-making-paths)**  
  Explains how issues are escalated (e.g. content disputes, abuse, catalogue policy questions) and who makes final decisions. Clarifies roles such as Product Owner, Platform Administrator, and Technical Lead in decision flows.

- **[10. Assumptions, Risks & Adaptation](#10-assumptions-risks--adaptation)**  
  Captures key assumptions about stakeholder availability and engagement, potential communication risks (e.g. low response from curators), and how the plan will be reviewed and adapted over time as Dream Project evolves.

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

The **Stakeholder & Communication Plan** defines *who* is involved in Dream Project, *what* they care about, and *how* we communicate with them throughout the life of the product.

Where the **Business Case** and the **Business Analysis Document** focus on *why* and *what* we are building, this document focuses on **with whom and in what way** we are having the conversations needed to make that vision real.

---
<br>

### 1.1 Context

Dream Project is a niche companion platform for gamers who care about:

- preserving and sharing **saves**,
- tracking **official + fan-made achievements**,
- curating **screenshot-based sticker albums**.

Even for an MVP, this means interacting with several distinct groups:

- regular players,
- retro/emulator fans,
- curators and content creators,
- platform administrators and the core product team,
- external services (e.g. retro achievement ecosystems).

Each group has different expectations, technical backgrounds, and communication styles.  
Without a clear, minimal structure, communication can quickly become ad hoc, inconsistent, and hard to trace.

---
<br>

### 1.2 Purpose of This Plan

The purpose of this document is to:

- **Identify and profile** the main stakeholder groups for Dream Project.
- **Clarify influence and interest** of each group, so we know where to invest more communication effort.
- **Define communication objectives** for each group (what we want them to know, feel, and do).
- **Specify concrete communication routines**:
  - what information is shared,
  - through which channels,
  - how frequently,
  - and who is responsible.
- **Describe escalation and decision paths** for sensitive topics (moderation, catalogue policy, integration issues).

In short, this plan should help the team answer questions like:

- “Who needs to be informed before we change this feature?”
- “How do we announce a new album template or an updated catalogue policy?”
- “Who decides when there is a conflict between curators and admins?”

---
<br>

### 1.3 Scope & Audience

**In scope:**

- Stakeholder groups defined in the Business Analysis Document (players, curators, admins, etc.).
- Communication activities related to:
  - product decisions and roadmap for Dream Project,
  - onboarding and supporting curators and early adopters,
  - moderation and catalogue policy,
  - integration changes that affect users.

**Out of scope:**

- Detailed marketing campaigns or paid advertising strategies.
- Legal agreements or formal contracts with external partners (these are referenced, but not fully described here).
- Internal HR processes (hiring, performance reviews, etc.).

**Intended audience:**

- Product Owner / BA responsible for Dream Project.
- Platform Administrators and moderation leads.
- Design, development, and QA team members.
- Anyone acting as curator/community contact for the platform.

---
<br>

### 1.4 How to Use This Document

- Use **Section 2–3** to understand *who* our stakeholders are and what they care about.
- Use **Section 4–6** when planning concrete communication activities:
  - announcements,
  - feedback rounds,
  - onboarding sessions for curators,
  - status updates for the internal team.
- Use **Section 7–9** as a reference for:
  - recurring meetings and checkpoints,
  - which channels to prefer for which audiences,
  - how to escalate decisions and conflicts.
- Use **Section 10** to:
  - keep track of assumptions about stakeholder engagement,
  - identify communication risks,
  - decide when the plan itself needs to be adjusted.

For a portfolio context, this document also demonstrates **how communication planning is approached from a BA perspective**—linking stakeholder analysis to practical, structured interaction patterns.

## 2. Stakeholder Landscape Overview

This section gives a **high-level map** of who is involved in Dream Project and how they relate to the platform.  
Later sections will describe each group and the communication details in more depth.

---
<br>

### 2.1 Stakeholder Map

For Dream Project, stakeholders can be grouped into four main clusters:

1. **Players & Community**
   - Regular Players (modern platform users)
   - Retro & Emulator-Focused Players
   - Global Content Creators & Community Organisers (EN)
   - Ukrainian Content Creators & Community Organisers

2. **Curators & Power Users**
   - Curators & Achievement/Album Set Creators

3. **Internal Platform Team**
   - Product Owner / Business Analyst
   - Design, Development & QA
   - Platform Administrators & Moderation Leads
   - Catalogue/Data Maintainers (may overlap with admins)

4. **External Services & Integration Partners**
   - Operators of external platforms whose data we integrate (e.g. achievement services)

The first two clusters are mainly **users and community**; the third is the **organisation running Dream Project**; the fourth includes **ecosystem partners** whose behaviour partially shapes what we can do.

### 2.3 Relationship Overview

At a conceptual level:

- **Regular Players** and **Retro Players** are the **core users**.  
  Their experience determines whether Dream Project has a reason to exist.

- **Curators** sit in the middle between users and platform:
  - they **shape content** (sets, albums),
  - they strongly influence how attractive Dream Project is for completion-focused players.

- **Content Creators & Community Organisers** amplify or ignore Dream Project:
  - if they adopt it, they bring players and real-world use cases,
  - if they don’t, the platform risks staying invisible.

- **Internal Platform Team** (PO/BA, devs, QA, admins, catalogue maintainers) translates all of this into:
  - requirements,
  - releases,
  - policies,
  - and ongoing operations.

- **External Services & Integration Partners** act as **data and ecosystem providers**:
  - their APIs and rules constrain what we can automate,
  - their stability and goodwill influence how robust certain features can be.

Understanding this landscape is crucial for the communication plan: not all groups need the same level of detail or the same communication frequency, but all of them can significantly affect the success of Dream Project in their own way.

## 3. Stakeholder Group Profiles

This section describes each stakeholder group in more detail:  
who they are, what they care about, what they fear, and what they need from communication.

---
<br>

### 3.1 Players & Community

#### 3.1.1 Regular Players (Platform Users)

**Who they are**

- Players who mainly use modern platforms (Steam, GOG, EGS, consoles).
- Might be curious about Dream Project as a **companion**, not as a replacement.
- Often time-poor and not deeply technical.

**Goals & Motivation**

- Quickly find **useful saves** (e.g. before key choices, after hard bosses).
- Track **progress and achievements** without dealing with complex tools.
- Get a **nice-looking overview** of their playthrough (albums, badges) without a lot of manual work.

**Concerns & Frustrations**

- Fear that the platform will be:
  - too complicated,
  - too “technical” (file paths, emulator jargon),
  - or not worth the effort versus just playing the game.
- Worry about **account security** and external profile linking.
- Don’t want to be spammed with notifications or long explanations.

**Communication Needs**

- Short, clear **onboarding**:
  - what Dream Project does,
  - how to perform one basic task (e.g. “download a save and use it safely”).
- Friendly, non-technical language and concrete examples.
- Occasional in-app tips or emails about **new simple features** (“You can now do X in two clicks”), not detailed technical updates.

**Preferred Channels (conceptually)**

- In-platform messages/tooltips.
- Lightweight email updates (optional, low frequency).
- Short FAQ/Help pages with concrete “How do I…?” answers.

---
<br>

#### 3.1.2 Retro & Emulator-Focused Players

**Who they are**

- Players who use emulators, fan translations, and retro achievement ecosystems.
- Often more technically confident and detail-oriented than regular players.

**Goals & Motivation**

- Have their **retro progress recognised and preserved** in a central place.
- Browse and share **saves** and **challenges** for legacy titles.
- Integrate with services like RetroAchievements when possible.

**Concerns & Frustrations**

- Suspicious of tools that might:
  - violate emulator or service rules,
  - trigger bans,
  - or break existing setups.
- Don’t want to maintain progress in too many different systems.
- Sensitive to half-baked integrations that silently fail.

**Communication Needs**

- Clear documentation on:
  - how integrations work (and what they *don’t* do),
  - what is read-only,
  - and how to safely use saves with emulators.
- Honest status updates if an integration is unstable, limited, or temporarily disabled.
- Ability to give **feedback** about edge cases and have it acknowledged.

**Preferred Channels (conceptually)**

- Documentation / knowledge base with concrete emulator examples.
- Changelogs or announcements in relevant communities (Discord, forums) when integrations change.
- Occasional surveys or feedback threads aimed at retro players.

---
<br>

### 3.2 Curators & Content Creators

#### 3.2.1 Curators & Achievement/Album Set Creators

**Who they are**

- Power users who enjoy:
  - designing fan-made achievement sets,
  - structuring “true 100%” routes,
  - and creating thematic sticker albums.
- Often already active in game-specific communities or wikis.

**Goals & Motivation**

- Have a **stable home** for their sets and albums.
- Receive **visibility and recognition** for their work.
- See real players actually **using and completing** their content.

**Concerns & Frustrations**

- Fear that:
  - their work will be buried, ignored, or lost,
  - tools will be clumsy or too limited,
  - or admins will change policies without explanation.
- Worry about:
  - having to do unpaid moderation work,
  - unclear rules about what they can/cannot create.

**Communication Needs**

- Clear curator **onboarding**:
  - how to create/edit sets and templates,
  - how versioning and deprecation work,
  - what quality guidelines apply.
- Regular updates on:
  - new curator tools,
  - changes in business rules that affect them (e.g. evidence, spoiler labelling).
- Access to **basic usage statistics** for their content (how many users started/completed it).

**Preferred Channels (conceptually)**

- Curator-focused documentation and tutorials.
- Dedicated curator announcement space (e.g. a specific channel or mailing list).
- Occasional live or async Q&A / feedback sessions.

---
<br>

#### 3.2.2 Global Content Creators & Community Organisers (EN)

**Who they are**

- Streamers, YouTubers, writers, and community organisers working mainly in English.
- Run events/challenges, maintain Discords, write guides, etc.

**Goals & Motivation**

- Show **verifiable progress** (sets, albums, stats) to their audience.
- Use Dream Project links as **“evidence”** or context for events.
- Make it easier for their community to **join shared challenges**.

**Concerns & Frustrations**

- Don’t want:
  - another complex system to maintain,
  - or a platform that could break in the middle of an event.
- Need clear rules on:
  - what is allowed (e.g. using logo, embedding links),
  - what support they can expect if something goes wrong.

**Communication Needs**

- Condensed “for creators” guide:
  - how to create an event using sets/albums,
  - how to share links,
  - what stats they can show.
- Clear, honest announcements about breaking changes or integration issues.
- A way to ask questions and get timely, pragmatic answers.

**Preferred Channels (conceptually)**

- Documentation section “for content creators”.
- Direct communication via email/DM for key partners.
- News/updates in public channels that their communities already follow.

---
<br>

#### 3.2.3 Ukrainian Content Creators & Community Organisers

**Who they are**

- Creators and community leads focused on **Ukrainian-language** audiences and contexts.
- Often care not only about games but also about **which games** (Ukrainian localisation, origin, Russian-linked).

**Goals & Motivation**

- Promote games with **Ukrainian localisation** or Ukrainian origin.
- Avoid or clearly flag **Russian-linked content** in their communities.
- Use Dream Project as a place where these distinctions are visible and respected.

**Concerns & Frustrations**

- Fear that:
  - Ukrainian support will be treated as a minor detail or ignored,
  - Russian-linked content will be quietly mixed in without context,
  - catalogue policy will be inconsistent.
- Worry that communication will be only in English, or that Ukrainian UI will lag behind.

**Communication Needs**

- Transparent explanation of:
  - catalogue policy for Russian-linked and Ukrainian-origin games,
  - how filters/flags behave for Ukrainian UI.
- Consistent Ukrainian-language communication for:
  - key changes,
  - issues that particularly affect Ukrainian users.
- Opportunities to provide feedback on how well the platform serves Ukrainian players and creators.

**Preferred Channels (conceptually)**

- Ukrainian-language documentation pages where possible.
- Social/Discord/Telegram channels frequented by Ukrainian gaming communities.
- Direct feedback loops with someone inside the team who understands the context.

  - possibly game metadata providers.

**Goals & Motivation**

- See their services used in a way that:
  - respects their terms and rate limits,
  - adds value for users,
  - does not create extra support overhead.

**Concerns & Frustrations**

- Integrations that:
  - hammer their APIs,
  - misrepresent their data,
  - or confuse users about who is responsible for what.
- Being associated with any behaviour that looks like cheating or scraping.

**Communication Needs**

- Clear description of:
  - how Dream Project intends to use their data,
  - what volume and frequency is expected,
  - how users will be informed about the origin of that data.
- Quick, respectful communication if:
  - API changes break the integration,
  - policy changes require adjustment on our side.
- A designated contact point on the Dream Project side (even if informal) to avoid confusion.

<br>

These profiles provide the **human context** for the more formal mapping and communication details in the next sections.  
Section 4 will translate this into an influence/interest view and outline the engagement strategy for each group.

---
<br>
<br>

## 4. Influence, Interest & Engagement Strategy

This section positions each stakeholder group by **influence** (ability to affect Dream Project’s success or direction) and **interest** (how much they care about its outcomes), and defines the **engagement style** we should use.

---
<br>

### 4.1 Influence / Interest Matrix

**Legend (Engagement Approach):**

- **MC – Manage Closely** (high influence, high interest)  
- **KS – Keep Satisfied** (high influence, lower day-to-day interest)  
- **KI – Keep Informed** (lower influence, high interest)  
- **M – Monitor** (lower influence, lower direct interest)

| Stakeholder Group                                    | Influence | Interest | Engagement Code |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Curators & Achievement/Album Set Creators           | High      | High     | **MC**           |
| Product Owner / Business Analyst                     | High      | High     | **MC**           |
| Design, Development & QA Team                        | High      | High     | **MC**           |
| Platform Administrators & Moderation Leads           | High      | High     | **MC**           |
| Regular Players (Platform Users)                     | Medium    | High     | **KI**           |
| Retro & Emulator-Focused Players                     | Medium    | High     | **KI**           |
| Ukrainian Content Creators & Community Organisers    | Medium    | High     | **KI**           |
| Global Content Creators & Community Organisers (EN)  | Medium    | Medium   | **KS**           |
| Catalogue / Data Maintainers                         | Medium    | Medium   | **KS**           |
| External Services & Integration Partners             | Medium    | Low–Med  | **KS**           |

(“Influence” here includes both direct decision power and the ability to attract or repel users.)

---
<br>

### 4.2 Engagement Strategy by Quadrant

#### 4.2.1 Manage Closely (MC)

**Groups:**  
- Curators & Achievement/Album Set Creators  
- Product Owner / BA  
- Design, Development & QA  
- Platform Administrators & Moderation Leads  

**Strategy:**

- **Frequent, two-way communication**:
  - involve them early in changes that impact content structures, moderation, or core UX;
  - use working sessions, backlog refinement, and feedback loops, not just “finished” announcements.
- Provide **context**, not just tasks:
  - explain why a feature is prioritised,
  - share data/feedback that drives decisions.
- Capture their feedback in a **visible backlog** (ideas, issues, improvements) so they feel heard and can see outcomes.

---
<br>

#### 4.2.2 Keep Satisfied (KS)

**Groups:**  
- Global Content Creators & Community Organisers (EN)  
- Catalogue / Data Maintainers  
- External Services & Integration Partners  

**Strategy:**

- Communicate **when it matters most**:
  - before and after changes that affect them directly (embedding options, catalogue rules, API usage).
- Keep communication **concise and concrete**:
  - what is changing,
  - when,
  - what they need to do (if anything).
- Offer a **clear contact point**:
  - so they know where to go when something breaks or they need clarification,
  - without overwhelming the core team with constant low-priority chatter.

---
<br>

#### 4.2.3 Keep Informed (KI)

**Groups:**  
- Regular Players (Platform Users)  
- Retro & Emulator-Focused Players  
- Ukrainian Content Creators & Community Organisers  

**Strategy:**

- Use **broadcast-style communication** for most updates:
  - in-app messages, release notes, lightweight posts in relevant communities.
- Focus on **benefits and simple actions**, not internal details:
  - “You can now do X”,
  - “Here’s how to link your retro account safely”,
  - “Filters for Ukrainian-localised games are now available”.
- Provide channels for **optional deeper feedback**:
  - surveys,
  - feedback forms,
  - occasional targeted Q&A, especially for retro and Ukrainian audiences.

---
<br>

#### 4.2.4 Monitor (M)

Currently there are no major groups placed in a pure “Monitor only” category; most identified groups either strongly affect success or are highly interested.  
Future stakeholders (e.g. potential investors, additional language communities) may initially be treated as **Monitor** until their influence/interest becomes clearer.

---
<br>

### 4.3 Practical Priorities

From a communication effort perspective:

1. **Curators, Internal Team, Admins (MC)**  
   - Need short feedback cycles and transparency.  
   - Misalignment here directly breaks the product.

2. **Players & Key Communities (KI)**  
   - Need clear, simple explanations and visible responsiveness to feedback.  
   - Their adoption determines whether the platform has real usage.

3. **Creators, Catalogue Maintainers, Integration Partners (KS)**  
   - Need timely, accurate information around changes that affect their work or systems.  
   - Good relationships here unlock growth and stability, but don’t require constant contact.

These priorities will drive the detailed communication plans, touchpoints, and channels in the next sections.

## 5. Communication Objectives

This section defines **what we want communication to achieve** for Dream Project – not just what we send, but the outcomes we expect in understanding, behaviour, and collaboration.

---
<br>

### 5.1 Overall Communication Goals

Across all stakeholders, communication should:

1. **Align expectations**
   - Everyone understands what Dream Project is (and is not), what the MVP includes, and what will likely come later.
   - Stakeholders know which parts of the platform are experimental, limited, or subject to change.

2. **Build trust**
   - Users feel safe linking accounts, uploading saves/screenshots, and investing time in sets and albums.
   - Curators and creators feel that their work is respected, attributed, and not arbitrarily changed.
   - External partners see that their data and rules are treated carefully.

3. **Support informed decisions**
   - The internal team can prioritise features and fixes based on clear feedback rather than assumptions.
   - Admins and catalogue maintainers can apply policies consistently thanks to documented decisions.
   - Stakeholders can decide how deeply they want to engage (e.g. casual player vs curator).

4. **Encourage constructive feedback**
   - Players and curators know *where* and *how* to share feedback or report issues.
   - Feedback loops are visible enough that people see it is worth their effort.

5. **Reduce noise and confusion**
   - Important changes are communicated clearly, at the right level of detail for each audience.
   - Stakeholders are not overwhelmed with irrelevant updates or jargon-heavy messages.

---
<br>

### 5.2 Objectives by Stakeholder Cluster

#### 5.2.1 Players & Community

**Objective A – Understand the value in simple terms**

- Make sure regular and retro players can answer:
  - “What can Dream Project do for me right now?”
  - “How do I safely try one feature (save, set, album) without breaking anything?”

**Objective B – Support safe, confident usage**

- Clearly explain:
  - how to use saves without losing progress,
  - what linking external profiles does (and does *not* do),
  - how privacy and visibility settings work.

**Objective C – Channel feedback into usable form**

- Provide obvious ways for players to:
  - report problems (corrupted saves, wrong sets, offensive content),
  - suggest improvements or new games/features,
  - feel that their input is acknowledged.

---
<br>

#### 5.2.2 Curators & Content Creators

**Objective D – Enable high-quality contributions**

- Ensure curators and set/album creators:
  - understand the tools and rules well enough to create good content,
  - know how versioning, deprecation, and evidence work.

**Objective E – Build a motivated core community**

- Communicate:
  - how their work will be surfaced (attribution, stats),
  - how the platform plans to support them over time,
  - what is expected in terms of quality and conduct.

**Objective F – Support community-facing events**

- Give global and Ukrainian content creators:
  - clear guidance on how to use Dream Project in events/challenges,
  - early notice of changes that might impact those events (e.g. integration updates).

---
<br>

#### 5.2.3 Internal Platform Team

**Objective G – Keep everyone working from the same picture**

- Ensure PO/BA, dev, design, QA, admins, and catalogue maintainers:
  - share a common understanding of priorities and scope,
  - know which BA artefacts are the current source of truth,
  - can see how stakeholder feedback has influenced decisions.

**Objective H – Support predictable delivery**

- Communicate decisions, trade-offs, and scope changes:
  - early enough to avoid unnecessary rework,
  - with clear rationale so team members understand “why”, not just “what”.

**Objective I – Make policies explicit and usable**

- Ensure moderation and catalogue policies (including Russian-linked and Ukrainian-origin topics) are:
  - written down in accessible language,
  - updated when decisions change,
  - easy to reference during day-to-day work.

---
<br>

#### 5.2.4 External Services & Integration Partners

**Objective J – Maintain respectful, low-friction relationships**

- Clearly explain:
  - how Dream Project uses their data,
  - expected traffic patterns,
  - how users are informed about data origin and limitations.

**Objective K – Avoid surprises**

- Provide timely communication about:
  - integration issues that may affect them,
  - major changes in how their services are used.

---
<br>

### 5.3 Success Indicators (Qualitative)

Communication is working well if, in everyday practice:

- Stakeholders can accurately describe their part of Dream Project without constant clarification.
- Most “surprises” are about **discovering improvements**, not about unexpected breaking changes.
- Feedback channels receive **actionable input** (clear issues, suggestions) more often than confusion or complaints about not being informed.
- Internal discussions refer back to this communication plan and BA artefacts instead of relying on fragmented chats.

These objectives set the direction for the more concrete communication planning in the next sections (who says what, when, and through which channels).

---
<br>
<br>

## 6. Communication Plan by Stakeholder Group

This section defines **who** receives **what** information, **when**, **how**, and **from whom**.  
Frequencies are indicative for MVP and should be adjusted once real usage patterns appear.

> **Legend – change triggers**
> - **BAU**: business-as-usual updates (small fixes, routine notes)  
> - **Feature**: new or changed capability users can feel  
> - **Policy**: moderation/catalogue/personal-data changes  
> - **Integration**: external API/linking behaviour affected  
> - **Incident**: outage, data issue, content abuse spike

## 8. Channels & Tools

This section describes **where** communication happens and **which tools** are used for different audiences.  
The exact products (Slack vs Discord, Jira vs GitHub Issues, etc.) can vary; the important part is *how* we use them.

---
<br>

### 8.1 Overview of Channel Types

For Dream Project we use four main categories of channels:

1. **In-Product Channels** – messages seen directly inside Dream Project.
2. **Documentation & Knowledge Base** – persistent reference material.
3. **Community & Social Channels** – where players, curators, and creators hang out.
4. **Internal Delivery & Coordination Tools** – where the core team plans and tracks work.

Each category has its own strengths; the communication plan (Section 6) references them in more detail.

---
<br>

### 8.2 In-Product Channels

**Purpose:** Reach users at the moment they actually use the platform.

- **Onboarding Tooltips & Guided Tours**
  - Used for: first-time explanation of core flows (uploading a save, joining an achievement set, filling an album).
  - Style: very short, visual, dismissible; no long text blocks.

- **In-App Notifications / “What’s New” Area**
  - Used for: player-facing release highlights, feature announcements, important changes in behaviour.
  - Style: 3–6 bullet summaries with links to docs; separate sections for “New”, “Changed”, “Known limits”.

- **Contextual Help Links**
  - Used for: deep dives when the user is already confused.
  - Example: “Having trouble with this save?” → link to a save-usage help article.

**Guideline:**  
If something **directly affects how a user interacts with a screen**, we should surface it *in* or *beside* that screen, not only in an external channel.

---
<br>

### 8.3 Documentation & Knowledge Base

**Purpose:** Provide a single, stable place for **detailed explanations**.

- **User Help Center**
  - Articles for regular and retro players (“How to download a save safely”, “How to link/unlink external profiles”, “How sticker albums work”).
  - Separate EN and UA versions for key topics over time.

- **Curator & Creator Handbook**
  - Guides for:
    - creating/maintaining achievement sets and album templates,
    - spoiler and evidence rules,
    - catalogue-sensitive topics (where relevant).
  - Used as the canonical reference in curator onboarding and roundtables.

- **Moderation & Catalogue Wiki (Internal)**
  - For admins and catalogue maintainers:
    - policy rules,
    - decision logs for tricky cases,
    - playbooks for abuse, Russian-linked flags, and UA-origin classification.

**Guideline:**  
If something will be referenced repeatedly (e.g. “How do we classify Russian-linked content?”), it must live in a **document**, not only in chat.

---
<br>

### 8.4 Community & Social Channels

**Purpose:** Reach and listen to **players, curators, and creators** in their natural habitats.

- **Global Community Channel (e.g. Discord / similar)**
  - Used for:
    - release announcements,
    - informal Q&A,
    - feedback threads,
    - early beta invitations.
  - Audience: global EN players, retro fans, some curators.

- **Ukrainian Community Channel (e.g. Telegram / Discord section)**
  - Used for:
    - UA-language announcements,
    - discussions about localisation, UA-origin games, Russian-linked flags,
    - UA feedback sessions and surveys.
  - Audience: Ukrainian players and creators.

- **Creator-Focused Spaces (optional)**
  - Could be a separate role/channel for content creators.
  - Used for:
    - event coordination,
    - sharing examples of how to embed Dream Project into streams/guides.

**Guideline:**  
Community channels are great for **conversation and sentiment**, but **not** the primary place for final decisions or long-term rules – those must link back to documentation.

---
<br>

### 8.5 Internal Delivery & Coordination Tools

**Purpose:** Coordinate the work of the core team and keep a traceable record.

- **Issue / Backlog Tracker** (e.g. GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.)
  - Holds:
    - epics, user stories, bugs, tech tasks,
    - references to BA artefacts (Business Case, BA Doc, rules).
  - Used in planning, weekly syncs, and release reviews.

- **Team Chat** (e.g. Slack / MS Teams / similar)
  - For quick questions, daily coordination, and short discussions.
  - Specific channels recommended:
    - `#product-ba` or equivalent (requirements & decisions),
    - `#engineering` (technical topics),
    - `#moderation-catalogue` (policy and edge cases),
    - `#incidents` (when something breaks).

- **Internal Docs / Repo**
  - BA artefacts (business-case.md, business-analysis-document.md, etc.).
  - Technical design notes, integration briefs, post-mortems.

**Guideline:**  
Important decisions agreed in chat should be **summarised in an issue or document**, with links, so they don’t disappear into history.

---
<br>

### 8.6 Status & Incident Communication

**Purpose:** Provide clear information when something is wrong or degraded.

- **Status Banner / Notice in App**
  - Used for: major outages, broken integrations, critical bugs impacting many users.
  - Short, factual: what is affected, what users should do (if anything), where updates will appear.

- **Status / Incident Log Page (optional for MVP)**
  - A simple page or document listing:
    - recent incidents,
    - impact,
    - resolution notes.

- **Direct Partner Communication (for integrations)**
  - Email or ticket to external services when:
    - we suspect our usage affects them,
    - their changes are affecting our users.

**Guideline:**  
For incidents, always prefer a **single, updatable source of truth** (status note or doc) and link to it from in-app banners and community posts.

---
<br>

### 8.7 Channel Selection Rules (Quick Reference)

When deciding **where** to communicate:

- **In-app**  
  → anything that changes how a screen behaves or affects many users right now.

- **Help Center / Docs**  
  → anything that needs a durable explanation, especially if it’s complex or policy-related.

- **Community channels**  
  → announcements, informal feedback, sentiment checks, and creator-facing conversation.

- **Internal chat + tracker**  
  → day-to-day coordination and implementation details; final decisions must be reflected in issues/docs.

Using these channels consistently helps keep communication **predictable** for both users and the team.

<br>
<br>

## 9. Escalation & Decision-Making Paths

This section defines **how issues are escalated** and **who decides what** when something goes wrong, is disputed, or needs a clear final call.

---
<br>

### 9.1 Principles

Dream Project follows a few simple principles for decisions and escalations:

- **Clear ownership** – every type of issue has a primary decision owner.
- **Small escalation steps** – start with the lowest level that can reasonably resolve the issue.
- **Traceability** – important decisions are written down (issue, note, or policy update).
- **User impact first** – when in doubt, protect users (safety, privacy, trust) and then refine.

---
<br>

### 9.2 Common Escalation Scenarios

#### 9.2.1 Content & Moderation Issues

**Examples:**

- Reported saves (corrupt, malicious, misleading).
- Reported screenshots (NSFW, spoilers without flags, offensive content).
- Toxic comments or abuse.
- Disputes about whether content should be removed.

**Path:**

1. **User → Report**  
   - User reports content via in-app report function.

2. **Triage – Moderator / Platform Admin**  
   - Reviews report, checks context and guidelines.
   - If clear violation → take action (hide/remove, warn user) and document briefly.
   - If borderline or unclear → escalate.

3. **Escalation – Platform Admin Lead + PO/BA (if policy is unclear)**  
   - Discuss edge case using moderation playbook and catalogue policy.
   - Decide:
     - keep as is,
     - adjust classification/flags,
     - remove or restrict content,
     - update guidelines.

4. **Decision Recording**  
   - Summary recorded in moderation log / wiki for similar future cases.
   - If guidelines change, docs updated and (if needed) curators informed.

**Decision Owner:**  
- Day-to-day: Platform Admin / Moderator.  
- Policy-level edge cases: Platform Admin Lead + PO/BA together.

---
<br>

#### 9.2.2 Catalogue & Policy Flags (UA-Origin, Russian-Linked, Localisation)

**Examples:**

- Whether a game should be marked as “Ukrainian-origin”.
- Whether a publisher is considered “Russian-linked”.
- Disagreement on localisation metadata (e.g. “has official Ukrainian localisation”).

**Path:**

1. **Suggestion / Issue Raised**  
   - By Catalogue Maintainer, Curator, or community feedback.

2. **Research – Catalogue Maintainer**  
   - Verify information (developer/publisher, official localisation sources, etc.).
   - Propose a classification with justification.

3. **Review – Platform Admin + PO/BA**  
   - Check proposal against catalogue policy rules.
   - Consider potential impact (filters, UA user expectations).

4. **Decision & Communication**  
   - Final classification applied in catalogue.
   - Decision noted in a short log (source links, reasoning).
   - If change is significant (popular title), UA-facing docs and/or announcement updated.

**Decision Owner:**  
- Catalogue classification: Catalogue Maintainer, approved by Platform Admin.  
- Policy rule changes: PO/BA + Platform Admin jointly.

---
<br>

#### 9.2.3 Technical Incidents & Integration Failures

**Examples:**

- Downtime or critical performance degradation.
- Achievement import or retro integration not working.
- Data inconsistency affecting user progress.

**Path:**

1. **Detection**  
   - Via monitoring, internal tests, or user reports.

2. **Initial Ownership – Dev Lead + Admin Lead**  
   - Confirm scope and severity.
   - Decide if it is:
     - minor (quiet fix),
     - major (requires status banner and fast communication).

3. **Escalation & Coordination**  
   - For major issues:
     - create an incident entry,
     - inform PO/BA and Platform Admin,
     - if external API involved, notify partner contact when appropriate.

4. **Resolution & Post-Mortem**  
   - Fix or workaround implemented.
   - Short incident summary written:
     - what happened,
     - impact,
     - fix,
     - follow-up tasks.
   - If user-facing, link summary from status note or release notes.

**Decision Owner:**  
- Technical response: Dev Lead.  
- User communication & messaging: PO/BA + Admin Lead.  
- Integration partner contact: Dev Lead or Admin Lead.

---
<br>

#### 9.2.4 Scope, Feature & UX Changes

**Examples:**

- Adding/removing core MVP features.
- Changing how sets/albums work from a user perspective.
- Decisions that affect curator tools or user flows.

**Path:**

1. **Proposal**  
   - From PO/BA, Dev, Curator, or community feedback.

2. **Impact Analysis – PO/BA**  
   - Check impact on:
     - existing requirements and BA artefacts,
     - stakeholders (players, curators, admins),
     - technical feasibility.

3. **Discussion & Alignment**  
   - With Dev Lead, QA, Admin representative, and (if relevant) Curators.
   - Decide whether the change:
     - fits MVP,
     - moves to later phase,
     - or needs a spike/prototype.

4. **Decision & Documentation**  
   - PO/BA makes final scope call (within agreed product constraints).
   - Update:
     - backlog,
     - BA/requirements docs where necessary,
     - communication plan (if change is user-impacting).

**Decision Owner:**  
- Product scope & priorities: PO/BA (with input from team).  
- Technical feasibility and implementation detail: Dev Lead.

---
<br>

#### 9.2.5 Stakeholder Conflicts

**Examples:**

- Curators vs Admins on content rules or visibility.
- Ukrainian community concerns about catalogue policy vs broader audience expectations.
- Conflicting requests from players vs technical constraints.

**Path:**

1. **Identify Conflict**  
   - Raised by any stakeholder or team member.

2. **First-Level Resolution – PO/BA + Relevant Leads**  
   - PO/BA, Platform Admin Lead, and (if needed) Catalogue Maintainer or Dev Lead:
     - clarify facts,
     - restate objectives,
     - explore options.

3. **Decision & Compromise**  
   - Choose option that best balances:
     - user safety and trust,
     - core vision of Dream Project,
     - realistic capacity.
   - Document rationale clearly (even if someone disagrees).

4. **Communication Back**  
   - Communicate decision to affected stakeholders:
     - curators,
     - communities,
     - internal team.
   - Update policy or docs if this sets a precedent.

**Decision Owner:**  
- Overall product-facing conflicts: PO/BA.  
- Policy-sensitive issues: PO/BA + Platform Admin Lead together.

### 9.3 Decision Roles Overview (RACI-Style, Simplified)

| Decision Area                      | PO/BA | Dev Lead | Platform Admin Lead | Catalogue Maintainer | Curators / Creators | External Partner |
|-----------------------------------|:-----:|:--------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
| Product scope & feature set       | **A/R** | C        | C                   | C                    | C                   | I                |
| Technical implementation choices  | C     | **A/R**  | C                   | I                    | I                   | I                |
| Moderation decisions (normal)     | I     | I        | **A/R**             | I                    | I                   | I                |
| Catalogue policy & flags          | **A/R** | I        | **A/R**             | R                    | C                   | I                |

> **Legend:**  
> **A** – Accountable (final call)  
> **R** – Responsible (does the work)  
> **C** – Consulted  
> **I** – Informed

This table is intentionally lightweight; it serves as a **quick reference** so that when something happens, the team knows *who is supposed to decide* and *who must be involved* before that decision is communicated.

---
<br>
<br>

## 10. Assumptions, Risks & Adaptation

This section summarises the **assumptions** behind the communication plan, the main **risks** if they do not hold, and how the plan will be **reviewed and adapted** over time.

---
<br>

### 10.1 Key Assumptions

1. **Minimal but committed core team**
   - There is at least:
     - 1 person acting as Product Owner / BA,
     - 1–2 engineers,
     - 1 QA / tester,
     - 1 UX/UI designer,
     - 1 part-time DevOps and/or ML Engineer
     - 1 person who can act as Platform Admin / Moderator (possibly part-time).
   - These people have enough time to:
     - attend the main ceremonies (planning, review),
     - handle basic moderation and catalogue decisions,
     - keep documentation roughly in sync with reality.

2. **Early, small but active community**
   - A modest number of:
     - Regular and retro players willing to try features and give occasional feedback,
     - A handful of curators and creators willing to experiment with sets and albums.
   - Communication volume remains manageable (no flood of support tickets).

3. **Preferred channels are acceptable to stakeholders**
   - Players are willing to read:
     - short in-app notes and occasional help articles.
   - Curators and creators accept:
     - using one main chat/community channel plus documentation.
   - Internal team is comfortable with:
     - one primary tracker and one primary team chat tool.

4. **Language split: EN + UA as primary focus**
   - English is acceptable as a shared language for global communication.
   - Ukrainian is important for:
     - UA-facing announcements,
     - catalogue policy and localisation topics,
     - parts of the help center over time.

5. **Low formal overhead**
   - Stakeholders do not expect full “enterprise-level” processes:
     - no complex approval chains,
     - no heavy slide decks for every decision.
   - Lightweight notes, wikis, and backlog entries are sufficient to keep a useful record.

---
<br>

### 10.2 Communication Risks

1. **Low Engagement from Key Groups**
   - **Risk:** Curators, retro players, or UA community leads do not respond to messages or surveys.
   - **Impact:** Features and policies may be designed based on guesses; curated content may stagnate.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Keep messages short and concrete with clear calls to action.
     - Occasionally ask *one* focused question instead of broad feedback.
     - Consider small incentives or public recognition for active curators/creators.

2. **Channel Fragmentation & Confusion**
   - **Risk:** Different messages are sent in different places (chat, docs, community posts) and contradict each other.
   - **Impact:** Stakeholders become unsure which source to trust; rumours and outdated info spread.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Always define a **single source of truth** (doc or page) for each significant change.
     - In chat/community posts, link back to that source.
     - Use in-app notices for anything that changes behaviour directly.

3. **Language & Localisation Gaps**
   - **Risk:** UA users receive updates late or in English only; catalogue policy around UA / Russian-linked topics is under-explained in Ukrainian.
   - **Impact:** Ukrainian community may feel secondary; misunderstandings around sensitive catalogue decisions.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Prioritise UA versions for:
       - catalogue policy explanations,
       - user-impacting policy changes,
       - key help articles.
     - If UA version lags, be explicit about it and provide a timeframe.

4. **Overloading Core Team with Communication**
   - **Risk:** Too many meetings and channels relative to team size; comms get skipped or rushed.
   - **Impact:** Hidden decisions, out-of-date docs, stakeholders not informed.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Keep ceremonies short and focused; cancel or merge if they have no content.
     - Prefer async updates (written summaries) where live calls are not essential.
     - Review this plan and deliberately **drop** low-value touchpoints if needed.

5. **Unclear Ownership in Edge Cases**
   - **Risk:** In tricky moderation or catalogue issues, no one feels authorised to decide; decisions drift or are inconsistent.
   - **Impact:** Confused stakeholders, unfair or contradictory outcomes.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Use the RACI table (Section 9.3) as the default rule.
     - If a new type of decision appears, explicitly assign an owner and update the table.

6. **Integration Communication Gaps**
   - **Risk:** External services are not informed when Dream Project changes how it uses their APIs, or when an issue affects them.
   - **Impact:** Loss of trust, possible throttling or blocking of integration.
   - **Mitigation:**
     - Keep a minimal integration brief per partner.
     - Send short, factual updates when behaviour changes or incidents occur.

---
<br>

### 10.3 Monitoring & Adaptation

To keep the communication plan relevant:

1. **Regular Light Review**
   - **Monthly:**  
     - Check if the main channels and frequencies still feel right for the core team and curators.
     - Note any recurring complaints like “I didn’t know this changed” or “This is too much info”.

2. **Post-Release Check**
   - After each significant release:
     - Review: did the right people know the right things in time?
     - Capture lessons in a short section of the release review/retrospective.

3. **Simple Indicators to Watch**
   - Increase in:
     - duplicate questions that should be answered in docs.
     - conflicts caused by people not being informed.
   - Decrease in:
     - curator activity without clear explanation,
     - response rates to important feedback requests.

4. **Feedback from Stakeholders**
   - Once or twice a year:
     - ask curators and key community contacts directly:
       - “Are you getting enough information, and in the right way?”
       - “What would you change about how we communicate changes?”

---
<br>

### 10.4 Updating the Plan

The Stakeholder & Communication Plan should be updated when:

- New major stakeholder groups appear (e.g. new language communities, formal partners, investors).
- The core team composition changes significantly (more people or fewer people).
- The communication pattern clearly does **not** match reality anymore (e.g. channels no longer used, new ones become central).
- Catalogue or policy discussions for Ukrainian / Russian-linked topics become more complex or frequent than anticipated.

Updates do not need to be heavy:

- Adjust the relevant tables (stakeholders, channels, RACI).
- Add a short “Last updated” note near the top of the document.
- For substantial changes (e.g. new policy escalation path), notify affected stakeholders using the existing communication channels.

In this way, the plan stays **practical and alive**, supporting Dream Project as it grows instead of becoming another static document that everyone quietly ignores.
