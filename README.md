# Portfolio Overview

Hi, and welcome to my GitHub portfolio repository! 🙂 If you arrived here via the link in my CV, you already have an idea of what to expect; if you found this by browsing GitHub, I’m also glad you’re here. This repository is a showcase of my work as a **Business Analyst**, and to some extent, as a **future BI/Data Analyst**. Each project here reflects my approach to business analysis techniques, documentation writing, and process visualisation, which I will implement in real projects.  

## 🏷️ Repository Structure

This portfolio is split into two main sections:

1. **💼 Business Analysis Examples**  
  This section gathers several of my **Business Analysis projects**, each created to demonstrate a different aspect of BA work — from requirements documentation and process design to stakeholder analysis and modelling.  Every project in this section was approached as if it were a real client scenario: I analyzed business needs, identified objectives and constraints, and translated them into structured deliverables. Check out featured projects: [BA Examples](./BA_examples/README.md)

2. **📊 Data Analysis Tasks (WIP)**  
   Various exercises and dashboards for Data Analysis and BI built using **Power BI**, **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, **pandas**, and more. This section will evolve over time as I continue developing my technical skills. You can check the latest updates here:   [Data Analysis Tasks](./DA_examples/README.md).

## 📄 CV

And finally, here's a link to my CV, so that it's all in one place. [CV](./CV/CV.pdf)
