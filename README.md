# Portfolio Overview

Hi, and welcome to my GitHub portfolio repository! 🙂 If you arrived here via the link in my CV, you already have an idea of what to expect; if you found this by browsing GitHub, I’m also glad you’re here. In short, this is my portfolio for the position of a business analyst and a little bit for the future as a BI/data analyst.

## 🏷️ Repository Structure

This portfolio is split into two main sections:

1. **Dream Project / Zanarkand Project**  
     Dive into the related business analysis deliverables for my product, codenamed _Dream Project_. (The working title _Zanarkand Project_ will stick around until inspiration strikes!) Explore all related documents here: [Dream Project](./DreamProject_BA_Docs/README.md).

2. **Data Analysis Tasks (WIP)**  
   Various exercises for Data Analysis and BI in Power BI, Python, R, SQL, pandas, and more. I’ll be updating this section regularly as I sharpen my skills here. Check out the current tasks and summaries:  [Data Analysis Tasks](./DA_examples/README.md).
